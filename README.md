# pandas_challenge

This repository brings a python pandas solution in the education sector to analyze city's school district data.
For these analysis both datasets imported, merged, and the aggregate data diplayed in to python pandas dataframes.

## PYCITYSCHOOLS REPORT


After analyzing the PyCitySchool data, several considerations can be made, including the following:

In general, the average success rates in mathematics are lower than those in reading
The budget of district schools is generally higher than that of charter schools (output 35), but as can be seen in the tables, the top 5 schools are all charter schools (output 22) while the bottom 5 are all district schools (output 23) .
The results of the "Scores by School Spending" table (output 29) shows an inverse relationship between test scores and school budgets. Overall, schools with lower budgets performed better on tests. In contrast, schools with higher expenditures per student ($645-675) performed lower than schools with smaller budgets (<$585 per student).
In terms of “grades by school size”, schools with more than 2,000 students have much lower pass rates than those with less than 2,000 students (output 32).
